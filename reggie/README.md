# Reggie â€” the Lua VM specification

Reggie is a module that specifies and implements a register-based (hence the name) VM. It defines memory model, instruction set, and behaviors associated in order to describe lua computations.

_Design have taken inspiration from BEAM VM._

## Reggie bytecode compiler

Although the Reggie runtime VM and bytecode compiler are mentioned as being separate systems, it is noted that they are the part of the same API. Bytecode generation is not guaranteed to be stable across releases or even to contain serializable representation. There is no verification process of the bytecode, meaning that compiler and runtime are closely coupled together. Bytecode compiler is guaranteed to produce a valid code, otherwise behavior is undefined (aka. expect crashed in the best cases, and unnoted data corruption in the worst).

## Abstract machine specification

Reggie has a number of different global registers, and a few local ones, constraint to function call frames. The machine does not have, nor allow arbitrary memory read/writes outside of the value mutation. The code running in VM is inherently single-threaded, meaning that there is no synchronization primitives defined, and code cannot concurrently access data structures.

Reggie's register can be of different [data types](#vm-data-values), notably:

- Nil (a special distinct from any other type of value)
- 64-bit IEEE-754 Floating point number
- UTF-8 string
- [Table](#table) data structure
- [Function reference](#function)
- Arbitrary external data reference ([userdata](#userdata))
- [Dynamic](#dynamic) can contain all of the types defined above.

#### Type notation

There is a shorthand notation for the Reggie's supported types:

- N - nill
- F - 64 bit IEEE-754 float
- I - 32 bit integer <!-- -   L - 64 bit integer -->
- S - string
- T - table
- C - function
- A - native function
- U - userdata
- D - dynamic

### Data registers

There three sets of data registers: argument, extended argument, local, and accumulator registers. All of these have variants for each of the types that Reggie supports, except for nil.

#### Accumulator registers

They are the primary way to operate upon a value. There is one register per each data type except for nil. They are global to the VM.

The notation used for addressing each of the registers is AX where X is the [shorthand notation of the type of a register](#type-notation)

#### Argument registers

Argument registers are global to the VM instance. There is set of N registers defined for each type of data values that Reggie supports, where N is defined by the concrete implementation of Reggie.

There is also a set of extended argument registers for each type. They are expected to be less performant than N of nominal ones. There is no limitation (other than instruction addressing constraints) of an amount of extended registers.

The notation used for addressing each of the registers is RX0-RXN for nominal argument, and ExtRX0-ExtRXN for extended ones, where X is the [shorthand notation of the type of a register](#type-notation)

#### Local registers

Upon execution of [global scope](#global-scope) or a [function call](#function-call-convention) the finite amount of local registers may be allocated for use. They are persisted in a function call frame. The bytecode compiler and Reggie VM compute the amount of local registers needed ahead of time, so for the code being executed, there is practically unlimited local registers, but in reality, the least amount needed is computed by the Reggie VM.

The notation used for addressing each of the local registers is LX0-LXN, where X is the [shorthand notation of the type of a register](#type-notation)

### Special use registers

The VM also defines couple of special use-case registers, such as:

- Program counter (PC)
- Return address (RA)
- Value count (VC)
- Test flag (TF)
- Type test result (TTR)

#### Program counter

Is the byte-offset of the currently executing instruction. It is global to the VM, and cannot be read, nor set directly.

#### Return address

Is the byte-offset of the instruction that currently executing function should jump to when execution reaches [return instruction](#return-instruction). It is located in every call stack, and is persisted between function calls. It cannot be read, nor set directly, rather `call` `typed_call` and `ret` instruction rely on it's value.

#### Value count

Program readable and writable global register. It contains the amount of argument the function was called with, or the amount of arguments function returns.

#### Test flag

Is set to appropriate value of `EQ`, `NE`, `LT` and `GT` when [comparing two values for equality](#eqtestxyz) or [ordering](#testxyz). Is global to the runtime, cannot be read nor set directly.

#### Type test result

Is set to appropriate value of `N`, `F`, `S`, `T`, `C`, `U` when performing [type test](#type_test). Is global to the runtime, cannot be read nor set directly.

### Modules

`TODO`

### Global scope

There is two scopes of instruction in Reggie bytecode: global and local. Global scope can execute all of the instructions local scope can (including return) but also gains ability to provide function definitions. Values can be defined with name association in the [global scope](#global-values). The values of global scopes can be queried, modified and added from any place, including the host Reggie's runtime and FFI calls.

Values on the global are stored in cells. There is two ways to address a global: either with it's associated string name, or via it's global_cell_ref.

### Functions

`TODO`

### Function call convention

There two variants of functions: lua function and native ones.

There is two ways to call a Reggie lua function. Either with `call` or `typed_call`. Let's start with `call`.

Call operand calls the value in the AC register. The arguments to a function are provided via the argument registers RD0 through RDN. If the number of arguments exceed that of N, then the rest of the arguments should be placed in ExtRD registers. Operand also takes the number of arguments passed via the [VC](#value-count) register.

Upon invoking `call` instruction, the new stack frame is created with the size determined from callee's function metadata. The callee receives all of it's args through RD and ExtRD registers.

Returned values are placed in the RD0-RDN and ExtRD registers. The [VC](#value-count) register should be set to the amount of values returned from the function.

Calling function with `typed_call` is only possible when the bytecode compiler or Reggie VM can guarantee that the callee expects to be called with typed arguments. There are no implicit checks to verify that the function is compatible with calling signature. Argument to the callee are passed through RX0-RXN and ExtRX registers, where X is the [shorthand notation of the type of a register](#type-notation). [VC](#value-count) register is not expected to be set neither on call, nor on return.

Bot `call` and `typed_call` set [RA](#return-address) register in the callee's scope to the offset where function should return after it's invocation is done.

It is to be noted, that calling a function is expected to clobber all of the argument, extended argument, accumulator, and special use registers, so relying on them staying unchanged after the call is complete is a futile effort. In order to persist values after function call, it is advised to put them into local registers, since those are restored after the function call is done.

There is two ways to call a native function. Either with `native_call` or `typed_call`.

`native_call` will call function located in AA register. The callers conventions are the same as `call`.

`native_typed_cal` follows the same principle as `typed_call`, except calling a native function in AA register.

### Foreign function interface (FFI)

### Error handling

`TODO`

## Optimizations and the JIT

Reggie is expected to do static and dynamic optimizations, including JIT compilation. The bytecode specification is designed to accomplish such endeavors. This means that a single function declaration may have different compiled representations, depending on desired optimizations.

### Global values

A single function may depend not strictly on it's arguments, but also on a values global values. Local values, such as arguments (and potentially upvalues in the future) are a lot easier to track and optimize. Global values on the other hand can change in unrelated places, such as in a different module, in a host environment, or in the FFI call. In order to provide better code generation, a function definition may register a hook on a value change, meaning that a change of a global value type may bring unexpected performance pitfalls, such as code de-optimization. The changes made to globals are expected to be tracked, so both reads and writes are going to be affected by it.
